# [SoundCloud: How to avoid copyright infringement?](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003566668-How-to-avoid-copyright-infringement)

> The best way to avoid copyright infringement is to ensure that you don’t use anything created by someone else. Simple as that.

Here are some of the issues you might want to consider before uploading something to SoundCloud:

## For uploads containing musical works:

Can you answer “yes” to all of the following questions?

* Did you compose the music yourself?
* Did you write the lyrics yourself?
* Did you record and produce the track yourself or do you have permission from the producer or record label that made the sound recording?
* Do you have written permission from all copyright owners to use any samples contained in the track? 

Can you answer “no” to all of the following questions?

* Were you signed to a record label when you recorded the track?
* Do you have a publishing deal?
* Are you a member of a performing rights organization or collecting society?
* Have you licensed your track to anyone else?
* Does the track contain the entirety or any part of someone else's song(s) Is it based on someone else’s song(s)?

## For other tracks, including field recordings, podcasts, audiobooks or voice messages:
Can you answer “yes” to all of the following questions?

* Is the recording spontaneous, as opposed to being recited from a script, play or book (other than one written by you)?
* Is it a recording of your performance?
* Did you make the recording yourself?
* Do you have the permission of anyone else appearing in the recording to upload and share the recording on SoundCloud?

 Can you answer “no” to all of the following questions?

* Is the recording rehearsed or recited from a script, play or book (other than one written by you)?
* Does the recording contain any music or excerpts from other copyright works (e.g. movie dialogue)?

## What if I uploaded the track as private, isn't that okay? 
Even if it is for your own personal use, you won’t be allowed to upload a copyrighted track to your SoundCloud profile as a private track, as it is still possible to share private tracks to other listeners.
