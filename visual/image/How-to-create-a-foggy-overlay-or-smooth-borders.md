# How to create a foggy, ink-blotty overlay or just smoothen sharp corners?

Create a new transparent layer.

Fill the background with a very distinctive color.

Take the eraser.

Set it's size very small and medium opacity.

Go over the corners and borders and roughly erase it. It is preffered
to do it perpendiclary and not even.

Repeat this multiple times by decreasing opacity.

When done, create a new layer with a distinctive opposite color to distinguish the erased parts.

Merge them together.

Replace the erased layer's color with alpha.

What will be left will be the foggy border that can be later colorized or alphaed.

See [foggy-borders](foggy-borders) for examples.
