## Sizes

### Presets

* Custom, custom.

### PPI

* Preview - 600
* Regular picture - 1200
* Good picture - 2400
* Excelent picture - 7200

> Resolution affects color and details. Lower resolution will be blurier and simpler in colors (but scans faster).

## Dust & scratches

* Infra - must be deactivated for BW (click on 'x' button in the left bar).
* SRDx - works for BW.

Too much fixing may make the image blurry.

> One way to avoid few scratches is to decrease the resolution.

### Tips

* Avoid affecting non-damaged places by using a selector.
* Not detecting? Increase the Detection scale.
